"""Task 2.2: Personal Tutor with Memory.

A chat loop with a local Ollama model (through LangChain) that remembers the
conversation using a list of messages. Commands: /reset clears the memory,
/count shows how many messages are stored, bye exits. Memory is trimmed to
the system message plus the last 8 messages, and the tokens sent are shown
after every answer. Stretch: a second list keeps the user's questions, and
on bye the tutor prints how many were asked, plus the first and last one.
